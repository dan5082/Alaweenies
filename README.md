# Alaweenies
This a project that Danny Dore, Daniel Niewierowski, Justin Isla, and Aayush Mishra worked on for CS411. 

## Disclaimer:
Due to obstacles and challenges, the project was not fully implemented as intended. 

However, the project still has all the basic features and works pretty well.


The final commit contains a dump of all the files that were used in this project. 


You can look for the "alaweenies app" folder for the code we wrote.
## Team Breakdown: 
Danny Dore worked primarily on the front-end of the project, implementing Bootstrap 4, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript/jQuery.


Daniel Niewierowski worked primarily on the backend of the project using Django, MySQL, and bash scripts. 


Justin Isla worked primarily on the backend of the project using Django and MySQL.

## About This Project:
The project implemented an online ordering system for the imaginary coffee and hot dog shop, Alaweenie’s. 

Alaweenie’s Hot Dogs & Coffee is a chain restaurant with five locations in Champaign, IL, Chicago, IL, Philadelphia, PA, and Portland, OR. 


Alaweenie’s wants to be able to expand their customer base, so they want to build a delivery service. 


Now, customers can order delivery if the customer does not want to have to travel to the restaurant for a meal. 


Alaweenie’s envisions the dream of becoming a nationwide chain in major markets, delivering hot dogs and coffee to customers of all kinds, and when the business decides to expand, the delivery service will make it easier to grow a customer base.
